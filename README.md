# Analysing Performance of docker-slim

In this report, I study [docker-slim](https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim), which is an open sourced software used to reduce the size of images. Also, slim images were benchmarked against the original image to see how much memory and processing overhead they had.

Final report is available at `report-export.pdf`.
